# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 

- Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
- How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?

### Bad Visualization

**Accessibility:** 
1. The use of similar colors without distinction can make it hard for colorblind viewers to differentiate lines. A colorblind-friendly palette would help ensure everyone can perceive the data effectively.
2. Lack of symbols or patterns to differentiate data points impacts accessibility, making it challenging for those with visual impairments. Adding symbols would address this issue.
3. Direct data labels are absent, forcing viewers to interpret lines without context, which increases cognitive load. Labeling lines would improve comprehension.

**Reproducibility:** 
1. No data sources are cited, which means there is no way to verify or replicate the data. Including citations supports reproducibility and transparency.
2. There is no detailed explanation of the methods used to collect the data, making the visualization's claims untraceable. Providing a clear methodology would help verify findings.
3. Provenance rhetoric, or citing data sources, helps build trust and transparency in visualizations, which is missing here.

**Equity:** 
1. The unequal scale used for the candidates can mislead viewers, emphasizing changes disproportionately. A consistent scale would provide an equitable comparison.
2. The visualization emphasizes a larger increase for one candidate, despite a low base percentage, potentially misleading viewers. Normalizing starting values would make comparisons fairer.
3. Using balanced visual elements would align with the principles of neutrality and avoid unintentional bias in how trends are perceived.

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Accessibility:** Use a colorblind-friendly palette, add symbols for differentiation, and include data labels.
2. **Reproducibility:** Cite data sources, explain the methodology, and add a legend to support transparency.
3. **Equity:** Normalize starting values, use consistent scales, and consider visual elements that ensure a balanced representation.

These changes would make the visualization clearer, reproducible, and fair.

### Good visualization

**Accessibility:** 
1. The chart uses clear colors and symbols to differentiate lines, making it accessible to those with color vision deficiencies. The course material stresses using distinct colors and symbols for better inclusivity.
2. The labels and annotations are prominent and easy to read, reducing cognitive load. Simple and clean designs make visualizations more understandable.
3. The inclusion of an explanatory section improves understanding for audiences with varied expertise, making it more accessible to a broader audience.

**Reproducibility:** 
1. The data sources are clearly cited, making it possible for others to validate and reproduce the findings, which is essential for transparent and ethical practices.
2. The visual design is consistent and clean, adhering to standards of reproducible practices. It avoids unnecessary embellishments that could alter perceptions.
3. This visualization uses straightforward metrics (growth ratios), which allows anyone to retrace the steps, supporting a transparent and reproducible design.

**Equity:** 
1. The data representation is balanced, with consistent scaling across all metrics, ensuring viewers do not perceive one aspect as more important than the other. Balanced scaling prevents bias.
2. Providing contextual information helps viewers interpret the data fairly, rather than imposing a specific narrative, thus supporting an equitable perspective.
3. Including information on both incomes and house prices provides an equitable view by presenting the full picture rather than focusing on a single metric.

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Accessibility:** Consider adding interactive elements for more personalized exploration.
2. **Reproducibility:** Provide a link to the dataset for viewers interested in further analysis.
3. **Equity:** Include additional demographics (e.g., regional differences) to ensure the information is broadly representative. 

These improvements can enhance clarity, transparency, and fairness in the visualization.


- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
